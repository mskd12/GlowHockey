15/8/2012 Added code to abort with helpful message if graphics
commands are used without calls to initCanvas or turtleSim.

16/8/2012 sprites created inline get destroyed at the end of the
block.  If this block = main program, then destructors would be called
after closeCanvas.  This used to produce a segmentation fault.
Modified closeCanvas so that it sets display = NULL, indicating that
the canvas has been closed.  Modified removeSprite to first check if
display is not NULL, and only if so repaint it.  Now only poly has a
non trivial destructor: because it needs to remove the vertex array.
Sprite has a destructor which only calls canvas::removeSprite, which
in turn calls repaint only if canvas::display is not NULL.  For parts
of composite objects, the destructor called on sprite will call
removeSprite although it is not needed, but it does not do damage as
it is written.  Also modified class Text so that it paints only when
visible.  This was an obvious bug.

21/8/2012 Fixed wait bug.  (int) p/q means ((int) p)/q, apparently.

14/9/2012 Added Text(cx, cy, number) constructor.

14/10/2012 Added event handling.  made functions of keypress,
motionnotify. function charfromevent.  checkevent was already there.

22/10/2012 Added alternate font loading to canvas.cpp.  Thanks to
Kashyap and Shashank.

29/10/2012 Added mouse release event processing to canvas.cpp.  Also
made radius in circle protected, it was private earlier.

3/11/2012 Added miscellaneous accessors to graphics, e.g. getRadius,
and made some privates into protected.

8/11/2012 Fixed buttonrelease bug.
